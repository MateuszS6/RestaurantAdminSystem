# Restaurant Management System
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Restaurant Management System. This application is designed to manage restaurant operations including details, menus, and sales analytics. It was developed as part of the IN2033 Team Project Coursework at City, University of London.

## Project Overview
This Restaurant Management System offers a comprehensive suite of tools to efficiently handle various aspects of restaurant management. It provides functionalities for:
- Displaying restaurant details and staff information.
- Managing and updating menu items.
- Analyzing sales data through dynamic charts.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, we have demonstrated the ability to:
- Integrate advanced object-oriented programming techniques, including the use of interfaces, abstract classes, and packages, to structure a scalable application.
- Manipulate Java Swing to create intuitive and visually appealing menu pages for a better user experience.
- Apply JDBC for robust database connectivity, enabling seamless data transactions between the Java application and the SQL database.

## Features
- Restaurant Details: View and manage information about the restaurantâ€™s location, staff, and operational hours.
- Menu Management: Add, edit, and remove menu items with ease using a user-friendly interface.
- Sales Analytics: Generate and view sales charts that offer insights into restaurant performance, including daily sales and monthly comparisons.
